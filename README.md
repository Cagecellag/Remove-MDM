## 📝 Original Notes

> # Note: there is already a guide how to do this but it assums that iTunes doesnt block you and tells you that this devise is controlled by another device, this repo accounts for that.  
> You are doing this at your own risk!  
> Dont blame me if you get cought i am only posting this because i found a solution and i would like to share the exploit.  
>
> Heres the link to the other repo: https://github.com/2bf/remove-mdm  
> It explains the whole MDM in a better way.  
>
> The guide is in the releases tab,  
> heres the link if you cant find it: https://github.com/Cagecellag/Remove-MDM/releases/  
>
> Something we noticed, one of our MDM bypassed iPads got their MDM completely removed. We aren’t certain if it’s because we updated it to iOS 18.5 or just because it’s been nearly a year since we did the bypass exploit.  
>
> **Shit i need to say:**  
> This is 100% free, no need to install sketchy programs or pay for stuff.  
>
> MDM (Mobile Device Management) is a thing schools, companies, or groups use to control devices like iPads. They can stop you from installing apps they don’t like or send commands to the iPad.  
>
> Follow these steps to remove MDM from your iPad. Just know, it might break the rules of whoever owns the device. This is just for learning, so don’t get in trouble!  
>
> If you want to contact me in any way, email me at cagecell@protonmail.ch or send a message on Discord: @cagecell.be. Seriously, I really don’t mind someone asking for help or improvements. Just send a message on Discord and I’ll respond lighting fast.

## 📦 Where’s the Guide?

📍 Full step-by-step guide is in the [**Releases**](https://github.com/Cagecellag/Remove-MDM/releases) tab.

---

## 🤔 What is MDM?

**Mobile Device Management (MDM)** is used by schools, companies, and organizations to control iPads and other Apple devices:

- Restrict app installs
- Lock down settings
- Track usage
- Push remote commands

This repo helps remove those profiles **manually**.

---

## 🧪 Real-World Result

> One of our bypassed iPads had its MDM profile fully removed almost a year later.  
> Not sure if it was the iOS 18.5 update or just time — but it’s gone.  
> Let me know if this happens to you too.
