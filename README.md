# Note: there is already a guide how to do this but it assums that iTunes doesnt block you and tells you that this devise is controlled by another device, this repo accounts for that.
You are doing this at your own risk! 
Dont blame me if you get cought i am only posting this because i found a solution and i would like to share the exploit.

Heres the link to the other repo: https://github.com/2bf/remove-mdm
It explains the whole MDM in a better way.

The guide is in the releases tab, 
heres the link if you cant find it: https://github.com/Cagecellag/Remove-MDM/releases/

Shit i need to say: 

This is 100% free, no need to install sketchy programs or pay for stuff.

MDM (Mobile Device Management) is a thing schools, companies, or groups use to control devices like iPads. They can stop you from installing apps they don’t like or send commands to the iPad.

Follow these steps to remove MDM from your iPad. Just know, it might break the rules of whoever owns the device. This is just for learning, so don’t get in trouble!
